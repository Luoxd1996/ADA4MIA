# ADA4MIA: Active Domain Adaptation for Medical Image Analysis

* **ADA4MIA** is a benchmark repo dedicated to enhancing **Domain Adaptation** and **Active Learning** in medical image analysis. Our goal is to foster robust model development across varied medical datasets, facilitating straightforward evaluation and comparison of different methods.

* This repository collects various **state-of-the-art methods**, **open-source code**, and related **datasets** for the community. **If you are interested, you can push your implementations or ideas to this repo or contact me (hongqiuwang16@gmail.com) at any time**.

* This project was originally developed for our previous works. Now and future, we are still working on extending it to be more user-friendly and support more approaches to further boost and ease this topic research. **If you use this codebase in your research, please cite the following works**:
